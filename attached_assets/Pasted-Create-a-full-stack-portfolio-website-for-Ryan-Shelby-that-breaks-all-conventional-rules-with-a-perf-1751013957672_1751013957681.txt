üí° Unique Selling Points
This portfolio will stand out because it:

Transforms traditional portfolio conventions into entertainment
Demonstrates technical skills through creative implementation
Shows personality and humor while maintaining professionalism
Creates an unforgettable user experience
Proves that attention to detail extends beyond just code
üîß Development Timeline Estimate
Week 1-2: Setup, design system, and base components
